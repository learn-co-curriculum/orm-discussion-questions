# ORM Discussion Questions

Consider the following questions with the people at your table. Write down your answers in a notebook or on a whiteboard. 

1. First, discuss with your table - what is an ORM? Why is an ORM useful?
2. Pretend that you're building Twitter. Let's say that a tweet has a message and belongs to a User. A User has a username and has_many tweets. What columns would be on those two tables?
3. Now that we have our tables, pretend that we are defining a method on our User class that returns all the tweets. What SQL fires when this method is called? 
4. Writing out all of these database interactions by hand can be messy. How do you create a method on the superclass to make sure the correct SQL fires for each class?

```
class LiveRecord

  def self.all 
    # Add code here!
  end
end

class Dog < LiveRecord
end

class Cat < LiveRecord

end

Dog.all #=> 'SELECT * FROM dogs'
Cat.all #=> 'SELECT * FROM cats'
```
